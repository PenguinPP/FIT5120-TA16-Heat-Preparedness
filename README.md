# FIT5120-TA16-Heat-Preparedness

We are a highly motivated team with a diverse range of skills and educational backgrounds. As a team we hope to develop a project that will have a positive impact on the lives of others. Upon receiving our topic, we recognised that high temperatures are a growing public health concern in Australia, and we are determined to provide vulnerable individuals with the knowledge and resources they will need to safeguard their health.
