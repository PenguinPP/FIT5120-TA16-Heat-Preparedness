# FIT5120-TA16-Heat-Preparedness

We are a highly motivated team with a diverse range of skills and educational backgrounds. As a team we hope to develop a project that will have a positive impact on the lives of others. Upon receiving our topic, we recognised that high temperatures are a growing public health concern in Australia, and we are determined to provide vulnerable individuals with the knowledge and resources they will need to safeguard their health.

#Technology / Frameworks
We have constructed a web-app that targeted specifically at the elderly, to provide them with the crucial information they need to safeguard their own health during periods of extreme heat. We have utilised a three tier architecture, using Nodejs for the front-end and application server, and mySQL for the backend database. Specifically for the front-end we used ReactJS and for the application server we used ExpressJS.
